# Database-System-Design
The project concentrated on establishing the system's objectives, goals, and requirements. It included the development of ERD diagrams, their transformation into a relational database schema, and the crafting of SQL queries to facilitate effective data management.
How to Use
To run these SQL scripts, follow these steps:

Set up your database environment: Ensure that you have a SQL server installed (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server) where you can execute these queries.
Clone the repository: Download the scripts to your local machine or directly clone this repository using Git:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
Open your SQL client: Use your preferred SQL client (e.g., pgAdmin for PostgreSQL, MySQL Workbench, or SQL Server Management Studio).
Run the scripts: Open each SQL file in your SQL client and execute the queries to analyze and optimize the production processes.
Files Description
SQL_QUERIES.sql: Contains a series of SQL queries used for data extraction, analysis, and reporting of production metrics. These queries are essential for identifying key production bottlenecks and areas for process improvement.
D.sql: This file includes database schema definitions and possibly some data insertion queries that set up the initial state required for running the analysis in SQL_QUERIES.sql.
Requirements
SQL Server (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, etc.)
SQL Client software to run queries (e.g., pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio)
